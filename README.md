# beepbeep

The horn on Plymouth Roadrunners are specially made to sound like the Roadrunner character's beep sound. However, the user has to press the horn twice in perfect timing to truly emulate the Roadrunner sound.

This script will use a Raspberry Pie and relay to listen for horn button activation and automatically trigger the horn with the correct "Beep Beep" sound to closely emulate the Roadrunner beep beep.

The launcher.sh file should be used to launch the daemon.
